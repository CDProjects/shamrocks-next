Demoulin steps in after Marko Sallert, who led the team for two seasons together with assistant coach Linus Backman.\n\nUnder Sallert’s leadership, Shamrocks reached the Finnish Championship Final for the first time in club history in 2024, and he was also named Coach of the Year in Finland. In the 2025 season, the club narrowly missed the playoffs.\n\nExtensive experience in Finnish and international rugby\n\nDemoulin brings a wealth of experience as a player, coach and referee. He began playing rugby at age seven in France, was selected to the French youth national programme, and represented Racing Club France. His playing career included time in France’s 1st Division B and 2nd Division, also at semi-professional level.\n\nAs a coach, Demoulin has led U16 juniors in Nantes, coached a Helsinki club from 1999–2006 (winning two Finnish Championships), and served as Head Coach of the Finland men’s national team from 2001–2005. He has also worked across Finland as a development officer, coached the Finland women’s academy (2008–2011), and served as backs coach for the Finland women’s national team (2019–2022). In recent years, he has worked as a referee before returning to coaching.\n\n“Rugby is like chess – everything is built before the score”\n\nDemoulin describes his coaching philosophy as strategic and focused on developing players’ understanding and skills.\n\n– “I see rugby as a chess game. You must construct the play according to the opponent to be able to score. Everything that happens before the scoring moment matters,” says Demoulin.\n\nHe emphasises technical development, open communication, and leadership from experienced players. He views the team’s goals on a 1–3 year timeline.\n\n– “I want to win as soon as possible, but building the structure of the team comes first. Players should not carry unnecessary pressure about winning everything,” he adds.\n\nBeginners’ course continues – pre-season preparations begin soon\n\nShamrocks’ free beginners’ course on Thursdays from 20:30 to 22:00 continues for two more sessions: 11 December and 18 December.\nNew participants are welcome to join at any time.\n\nThe official pre-season begins in January 2026, giving the team five months of preparation before the Finnish Championship season kicks off.\n\nMore information: www.shamrocks.fi"}

While the scoreboard showed clear dominance, the mood in the team was focused and determined.\n\n“We weren’t clinical enough,” said team captain Samu-Petteri Pääkkö. “If we had finished our chances better, this could’ve been a triple-digit game. We know there’s still plenty to improve.”\nThe game featured standout performances from several players. Jay Robertson, returning from a long injury break, impressed both in attack and defense. Ari Gali Valls controlled the tempo with precision kicking, and the forwards dominated physically from start to finish.\n\nA Season with One Clear Goal: Redemption\n\nThis season is about more than good rugby – it’s about unfinished business. Shamrocks came heartbreakingly close to their first-ever Finnish championship last year, losing the final to Helsinki Warriors 15–13, just two points shy of glory.\n\n“That loss still stings,” admitted head coach Marko Sallert. “But it also gave us a clear path forward. The way the team responded this offseason was phenomenal – the best training attendance we’ve ever had.”\n“We’re no longer just a team of players – we’re a unit with structure, discipline, and hunger,” added assistant coach Linus Backman.\n\nThe 2025 men’s championship features six teams:\nOld Town Shamrocks (Porvoo), \nHelsinki Warriors, \nHelsinki Rugby Club (HRC), \nTurku Eagles, \nTampere Rugby Club (TRC), \nTallinn Kalev\n\nEvery team plays each other home and away. It’s a tight race where every match counts.\n\nPorvoo Is Backing Its Team\n\nThe fanbase in Porvoo has grown steadily – especially after last year’s home semifinal drew record attendance. Shamrocks have worked hard to turn match days into full experiences.\n\n🍔 Argentinian BBQ\n🍻 Shamrocks Bar with official serving license\n🍭 Family-friendly kiosk\n🎶 Atmosphere that carries into the 3rd half at Old Town Public House\n\n“It’s no longer just about the rugby,” said club chairman Stefan Rogers. “People come for the food, the community – and then they stay for the sport. That’s how we build something lasting.”\n\nNext Challenge: Kalev from Tallinn\n\nThe next fixture will be a true test: Tallinn Kalev, known for its tight, national-team-level cohesion, will visit Hammars on Sunday, June 16 at 13:00.\n\n“They’re a disciplined, physical side. But we’re playing at home, and we’ll make sure they feel it,” said captain Pääkkö. “We’ve set the tone – now it’s about raising the bar.”\nShamrocks will play three consecutive home games to start the season before heading into July’s away stretch with matches in Turku, Tallinn, Vantaa, Tampere, and Helsinki.\n\n📅 2025 Match Schedule – Old Town Shamrocks\n✅ May 24 – Shamrocks vs. Eagles 43–0 (Hammars), \nJune 16 at 13:00 – Shamrocks vs. Kalev (Hammars), \nJune 28 at 12:00 – Shamrocks vs. TRC (Hammars), \nJuly 5 at 12:00 – Eagles vs. Shamrocks (Turku), \nJuly 12 at 13:00 – Shamrocks vs. Warriors (Hammars), \nJuly 26 at 14:00 – Kalev vs. Shamrocks (Tallinn), \nAug 9 at 15:00 – HRC vs. Shamrocks (Vantaa), \nAug 16 at 14:00 – TRC vs. Shamrocks (Tampere), \nAug 30 at 14:00 – Warriors vs. Shamrocks (Helsinki), \nSept 6 at 13:00 – Shamrocks vs. HRC (Hammars)\n\n🎟️ Tickets: €5\n👶 Free entry for students, pensioners, and children\n🍻 3rd half: Old Town Public House\n\n🟢 Full Squad – Old Town Shamrocks 2025\nForwards:\nAkseli Peltoniemi (vice-captain), \nAlejandro Ruiz, \nCasey Dent, \nEric Nyblom, \nGlenn Kristjankroon, \nJay Robertson, \nJohn Helenius, \nJuuso Kataja, \nMarko Sallert, \nOtto Åkerberg, \nPetter Larsen, \nRobert Grön, \nStefan Rogers, \nTobias Weckström, \nTommi Paavilainen, \nTuomas Uurinmäki\n\nBacks:\nAlexander Bannatyne, \nAri Gali Valls, \nAvea Avea, \nDaniel Kerr, \nJarkko Tuoresmäki, \nJay Robinson, \nJemi Olander, \nJim Helenius, \nMarkus Winberg, \nNico Laurla, \nSamu-Petteri Pääkkö (captain), \nShane Breen, \nTommaso Canova, \nTommi Gali Valls, \nTommi Koski, \nWiremu Rahui"}

Tampere Rugby Club aloitti pelin vahvasti, mutta OTS osoitti jälleen kerran sinnikkyyttä ja päättäväisyyttä. Shamrocks käänsi ottelun edukseen toisella puoliajalla ja vei lopulta voiton lukemin 32–7. Tampere-pelin maaleista vastasivat Jay Robertson ja Widz Rahui, jotka molemmat tekivät kaksi maalia. Lisäksi varakapteeni Samu Pääkkö ja kapteeni Akseli Peltoniemi pääsivät myös maalin makuun. Alexander Bannatyne viimeisteli yhden onnistuneen lisäpistepotkun.\n\nOld Town Shamrocksin (OTS) kausi on ollut vahva, ja joukkue on tällä hetkellä sarjataulukon toisella sijalla, kun jäljellä on enää kolme ottelua. Kausi on ollut täynnä määrätietoisuutta, kovia voittoja ja muutamia haasteita, mutta Shamrocks on osoittanut olevansa varteenotettava voima. Joukkue on kerännyt 24 pistettä. Warriors Rugby club on ainoa joukkue joka on voittanut Shamrocksin. Shamrocksin tasainen suorittaminen on asettanut joukkueen loistavaan asemaan kauden loppusuoraa ajatellen. Seuraavat kolme ottelua ovat ratkaisevia pudotuspelien kannalta. Ensin OTS matkustaa Tallinnaan kohtaamaan Kalevin, sitten edessä on vieraspeli Turkua vastaan. Kausi päättyy kotiotteluun Kalevia vastaan. Toisen sijan varmistaminen sarjataulukossa on OTS:lle äärimmäisen tärkeää, sillä se tarkoittaisi kotivälierää sarjassa kolmanneksi sijoittuvaa joukkuetta vastaan. Shamrocks ymmärtää kotiedun merkityksen, erityisesti korkeiden panosten välieräottelussa, ja joukkue on päättänyt napata tuon paikan. Samaan aikaan sarjan voittaja etenee suoraan finaaliin.\n\nTämän kauden menestyksen takana ovat valmentajat Marko Sallert ja Linus Backman, jotka ovat onnistuneet luomaan joukkueelle yhtenäisen ja ennen kaikkea kurinalaisen pelitavan. Heidän johdollaan Shamrocks on kehittynyt kauden aikana ja pystynyt säilyttämään keskittymisensä ja suorituskykynsä kovissakin paikoissa.\n\nTämän vuoden finaalipäivä järjestetään Espoossa, ja se lähestyy kovaa vauhtia. Shamrocksin katse on tiukasti suunnattu tasaisen suoritustason ylläpitämiseen, sillä se on avainasemassa kauden vahvassa päätöksessä. Kotivälierän varmistamiseksi jokaisella ottelulla on merkitystä, ja joukkue valmistautuu antamaan kaikkensa tulevissa koitoksissa. Kausi lähestyy loppuaan, ja OTS-faneilla on paljon syytä olla innoissaan. Joukkue on vahvassa asemassa, ja muutamalla hyvällä suorituksella Shamrocks voi olla kotivälierässä ja taistelemassa mestaruudesta. Edessä on haastava tie, mutta Shamrocks on jo osoittanut, että sillä on tarvittava päättäväisyys ja kurinalaisuus selvitäkseen mistä tahansa esteestä. Kaikki katseet kohdistuvat tuleviin otteluihin, kun OTS jatkaa matkaansa kohti mestaruutta.\n\nJoukkue matkustaa lauantaina Tallinnaan pelaamaan Kalevia vastaan. Yksikin piste tuosta ottelusta varmistaisi paikan välierässä 21.9. SM finaalit pelataan 28.9 Espoon Leppävaarassa. Pudotuskarsintojen,sekä naisten ja miesten SM-finaalien lisäksi finaalipäivänä pelaa myös Shamrocksin U8 ja U13 juniorit.\n\nEnglish:\n\nShamrocks is doing exceptionally well and is competing for the Finnish Rugby Championship gold this year.\n\nOld Town Shamrocks traveled to Tampere over the weekend to play a crucial match in the Finnish Rugby Championship. Tampere Rugby Club started the game strong, but OTS once again demonstrated resilience and determination. Shamrocks turned the game in their favor in the second half and ultimately secured a 32-7 victory. The try scorers in the Tampere game were Jay Robertson and Widz Rahui, who both scored twice. Additionally, Vice-Captain Samu Pääkkö and Captain Akseli Peltoniemi also found the try zone. Alexander Bannatyne successfully converted one extra point.\n\nOld Town Shamrocks (OTS) has had a strong season and currently sits in second place on the table with only three games remaining. The season has been marked by determination, hard-fought victories, and a few challenges, but Shamrocks has proven to be a formidable force. The team has accumulated 24 points, with Warriors Rugby Club being the only team to have defeated Shamrocks. Consistent performance has put Shamrocks in an excellent position as the season heads towards its conclusion. The next three matches will be crucial for the playoffs. First, OTS will travel to Tallinn to face Kalev, followed by an away game against Turku. The season will conclude with a home match against Kalev. Securing second place in the standings is of utmost importance for OTS, as it would guarantee a home semi-final against the team finishing third. Shamrocks understands the significance of home-field advantage, especially in a high-stakes semi-final, and the team is determined to claim that spot. Meanwhile, the league winner advances directly to the final.\n\nThe success of this season is attributed to coaches Marko Sallert and Linus Backman, who have managed to instill a unified and, above all, disciplined style of play in the team. Under their leadership, Shamrocks has developed throughout the season, maintaining focus and performance even in tough situations.\n\nThis year’s finals day will be held in Espoo and is fast approaching. Shamrocks is firmly focused on maintaining consistent performance, as it is key to a strong finish to the season. To secure a home semi-final, every match counts, and the team is preparing to give its all in the upcoming challenges. The season is nearing its end, and OTS fans have plenty of reasons to be excited. The team is in a strong position, and with a few solid performances, Shamrocks could be playing a home semi-final and contending for the championship. The road ahead is challenging, but Shamrocks has already shown that it has the determination and discipline needed to overcome any obstacle. All eyes are now on the upcoming matches as OTS continues its journey towards the championship.\n\nThe team will travel to Tallinn on Saturday to play against Kalev. Even a single point from that match would secure a place in the semi-finals on September 21st. The Finnish Championship finals will be played on September 28th in Leppävaara, Espoo. In addition to the playoffs and the women’s and men’s Finnish Championship finals, Shamrocks’ U8 and U13 juniors will also be playing on finals day."}
