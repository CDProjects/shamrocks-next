    date: "2025-12-08", // Today's date
    content: `
Old Town Shamrocks Rugby has appointed France-born and long-time Finland resident Thierry Demoulin as the new head coach of the men’s first team. Demoulin steps in after Marko Sallert, who led the team for two seasons together with assistant coach Linus Backman.

Under Sallert’s leadership, Shamrocks reached the Finnish Championship Final for the first time in club history in 2024, and he was also named Coach of the Year in Finland. In the 2025 season, the club narrowly missed the playoffs.

Extensive experience in Finnish and international rugby

Demoulin brings a wealth of experience as a player, coach and referee. He began playing rugby at age seven in France, was selected to the French youth national programme, and represented Racing Club France. His playing career included time in France’s 1st Division B and 2nd Division, also at semi-professional level.

As a coach, Demoulin has led U16 juniors in Nantes, coached a Helsinki club from 1999–2006 (winning two Finnish Championships), and served as Head Coach of the Finland men’s national team from 2001–2005. He has also worked across Finland as a development officer, coached the Finland women’s academy (2008–2011), and served as backs coach for the Finland women’s national team (2019–2022). In recent years, he has worked as a referee before returning to coaching.

“Rugby is like chess – everything is built before the score”

Demoulin describes his coaching philosophy as strategic and focused on developing players’ understanding and skills.

– “I see rugby as a chess game. You must construct the play according to the opponent to be able to score. Everything that happens before the scoring moment matters,” says Demoulin.

He emphasises technical development, open communication, and leadership from experienced players. He views the team’s goals on a 1–3 year timeline.

– “I want to win as soon as possible, but building the structure of the team comes first. Players should not carry unnecessary pressure about winning everything,” he adds.

Beginners’ course continues – pre-season preparations begin soon

Shamrocks’ free beginners’ course on Thursdays from 20:30 to 22:00 continues for two more sessions: 11 December and 18 December.
New participants are welcome to join at any time.

The official pre-season begins in January 2026, giving the team five months of preparation before the Finnish Championship season kicks off.

PORVOO – MAY 2025

The 2025 Finnish Rugby Championship kicked off in style for Old Town Shamrocks, who delivered a statement win in front of a home crowd in Hammars, defeating Turku Eagles 43–0. While the scoreboard showed clear dominance, the mood in the team was focused and determined.

“We weren’t clinical enough,” said team captain Samu-Petteri Pääkkö. “If we had finished our chances better, this could’ve been a triple-digit game. We know there’s still plenty to improve.”
The game featured standout performances from several players. Jay Robertson, returning from a long injury break, impressed both in attack and defense. Ari Gali Valls controlled the tempo with precision kicking, and the forwards dominated physically from start to finish.

A Season with One Clear Goal: Redemption

This season is about more than good rugby – it’s about unfinished business. Shamrocks came heartbreakingly close to their first-ever Finnish championship last year, losing the final to Helsinki Warriors 15–13, just two points shy of glory.

“That loss still stings,” admitted head coach Marko Sallert. “But it also gave us a clear path forward. The way the team responded this offseason was phenomenal – the best training attendance we’ve ever had.”
“We’re no longer just a team of players – we’re a unit with structure, discipline, and hunger,” added assistant coach Linus Backman.

The 2025 men’s championship features six teams:
Old Town Shamrocks (Porvoo), 
Helsinki Warriors, 
Helsinki Rugby Club (HRC), 
Turku Eagles, 
Tampere Rugby Club (TRC), 
Tallinn Kalev

Every team plays each other home and away. It’s a tight race where every match counts.

Porvoo Is Backing Its Team

The fanbase in Porvoo has grown steadily – especially after last year’s home semifinal drew record attendance. Shamrocks have worked hard to turn match days into full experiences.

“It’s no longer just about the rugby,” said club chairman Stefan Rogers. “People come for the food, the community – and then they stay for the sport. That’s how we build something lasting.”

Next Challenge: Kalev from Tallinn

The next fixture will be a true test: Tallinn Kalev, known for its tight, national-team-level cohesion, will visit Hammars on Sunday, June 16 at 13:00.

“They’re a disciplined, physical side. But we’re playing at home, and we’ll make sure they feel it,” said captain Pääkkö. “We’ve set the tone – now it’s about raising the bar.”
Shamrocks will play three consecutive home games to start the season before heading into July’s away stretch with matches in Turku, Tallinn, Vantaa, Tampere, and Helsinki.

    content: `Old Town Shamrocks matkusti viikonloppuna Tampereelle pelaamaan
          erittäin tärkeän ottelun Rugbyn SM-sarjassa. Tampere Rugby Club
          aloitti pelin vahvasti, mutta OTS osoitti jälleen kerran sinnikkyyttä
          ja päättäväisyyttä. Shamrocks käänsi ottelun edukseen toisella
          puoliajalla ja vei lopulta voiton lukemin 32–7. Tampere-pelin
          maaleista vastasivat Jay Robertson ja Widz Rahui, jotka molemmat
          tekivät kaksi maalia. Lisäksi varakapteeni Samu Pääkkö ja kapteeni
          Akseli Peltoniemi pääsivät myös maalin makuun. Alexander Bannatyne
          viimeisteli yhden onnistuneen lisäpistepotkun.
          
          Old Town Shamrocksin (OTS) kausi on ollut vahva, ja joukkue on tällä
          hetkellä sarjataulukon toisella sijalla, kun jäljellä on enää kolme
          ottelua. Kausi on ollut täynnä määrätietoisuutta, kovia voittoja ja
          muutamia haasteita, mutta Shamrocks on osoittanut olevansa
          varteenotettava voima. Joukkue on kerännyt 24 pistettä. Warriors Rugby
          club on ainoa joukkue joka on voittanut Shamrocksin. Shamrocksin
          tasainen suorittaminen on asettanut joukkueen loistavaan asemaan
          kauden loppusuoraa ajatellen. Seuraavat kolme ottelua ovat ratkaisevia
          pudotuspelien kannalta. Ensin OTS matkustaa Tallinnaan kohtaamaan
          Kalevin, sitten edessä on vieraspeli Turkua vastaan. Kausi päättyy
          kotiotteluun Kalevia vastaan. Toisen sijan varmistaminen
          sarjataulukossa on OTS:lle äärimmäisen tärkeää, sillä se tarkoittaisi
          kotivälierää sarjassa kolmanneksi sijoittuvaa joukkuetta vastaan.
          Shamrocks ymmärtää kotiedun merkityksen, erityisesti korkeiden
          panosten välieräottelussa, ja joukkue on päättänyt napata tuon paikan.
          Samaan aikaan sarjan voittaja etenee suoraan finaaliin.

          Tämän kauden menestyksen takana ovat valmentajat Marko Sallert ja
          Linus Backman, jotka ovat onnistuneet luomaan joukkueelle yhtenäisen
          ja ennen kaikkea kurinalaisen pelitavan. Heidän johdollaan Shamrocks
          on kehittynyt kauden aikana ja pystynyt säilyttämään keskittymisensä
          ja suorituskykynsä kovissakin paikoissa.

          Tämän vuoden finaalipäivä järjestetään Espoossa, ja se lähestyy kovaa
          vauhtia. Shamrocksin katse on tiukasti suunnattu tasaisen
          suoritustason ylläpitämiseen, sillä se on avainasemassa kauden
          vahvassa päätöksessä. Kotivälierän varmistamiseksi jokaisella
          ottelulla on merkitystä, ja joukkue valmistautuu antamaan kaikkensa
          tulevissa koitoksissa. Kausi lähestyy loppuaan, ja OTS-faneilla on
          paljon syytä olla innoissaan. Joukkue on vahvassa asemassa, ja
          muutamalla hyvällä suorituksella Shamrocks voi olla kotivälierässä ja
          taistelemassa mestaruudesta. Edessä on haastava tie, mutta Shamrocks
          on jo osoittanut, että sillä on tarvittava päättäväisyys ja
          kurinalaisuus selvitäkseen mistä tahansa esteestä. Kaikki katseet
          kohdistuvat tuleviin otteluihin, kun OTS jatkaa matkaansa kohti
          mestaruutta.

          Joukkue matkustaa lauantaina Tallinnaan pelaamaan Kalevia vastaan.
          Yksikin piste tuosta ottelusta varmistaisi paikan välierässä 21.9. SM
          finaalit pelataan 28.9 Espoon Leppävaarassa. Pudotuskarsintojen,sekä
          naisten ja miesten SM-finaalien lisäksi finaalipäivänä pelaa myös
          Shamrocksin U8 ja U13 juniorit.

          Shamrocks is doing exceptionally well and is competing for the Finnish
          Rugby Championship gold this year.


          Old Town Shamrocks traveled to Tampere over the weekend to play a
          crucial match in the Finnish Rugby Championship. Tampere Rugby Club
          started the game strong, but OTS once again demonstrated resilience
          and determination. Shamrocks turned the game in their favor in the
          second half and ultimately secured a 32-7 victory. The try scorers in
          the Tampere game were Jay Robertson and Widz Rahui, who both scored
          twice. Additionally, Vice-Captain Samu Pääkkö and Captain Akseli
          Peltoniemi also found the try zone. Alexander Bannatyne successfully
          converted one extra point.


          Old Town Shamrocks (OTS) has had a strong season and currently sits in
          second place on the table with only three games remaining. The season
          has been marked by determination, hard-fought victories, and a few
          challenges, but Shamrocks has proven to be a formidable force. The
          team has accumulated 24 points, with Warriors Rugby Club being the
          only team to have defeated Shamrocks. Consistent performance has put
          Shamrocks in an excellent position as the season heads towards its
          conclusion. The next three matches will be crucial for the playoffs.
          First, OTS will travel to Tallinn to face Kalev, followed by an away
          game against Turku. The season will conclude with a home match against
          Kalev. Securing second place in the standings is of utmost importance
          for OTS, as it would guarantee a home semi-final against the team
          finishing third. Shamrocks understands the significance of home-field
          advantage, especially in a high-stakes semi-final, and the team is
          determined to claim that spot. Meanwhile, the league winner advances
          directly to the final.


          The success of this season is attributed to coaches Marko Sallert and
          Linus Backman, who have managed to instill a unified and, above all,
          disciplined style of play in the team. Under their leadership,
          Shamrocks has developed throughout the season, maintaining focus and
          performance even in tough situations.


          This year’s finals day will be held in Espoo and is fast approaching.
          Shamrocks is firmly focused on maintaining consistent performance, as
          it is key to a strong finish to the season. To secure a home
          semi-final, every match counts, and the team is preparing to give its
          all in the upcoming challenges. The season is nearing its end, and OTS
          fans have plenty of reasons to be excited. The team is in a strong
          position, and with a few solid performances, Shamrocks could be
          playing a home semi-final and contending for the championship. The
          road ahead is challenging, but Shamrocks has already shown that it has
          the determination and discipline needed to overcome any obstacle. All
          eyes are now on the upcoming matches as OTS continues its journey
          towards the championship.


          The team will travel to Tallinn on Saturday to play against Kalev.
          Even a single point from that match would secure a place in the
          semi-finals on September 21st. The Finnish Championship finals will be
          played on September 28th in Leppävaara, Espoo. In addition to the
          playoffs and the women’s and men’s Finnish Championship finals,
          Shamrocks’ U8 and U13 juniors will also be playing on finals day.
